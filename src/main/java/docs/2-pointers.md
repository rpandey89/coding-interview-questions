The **two pointers pattern** is an efficient technique used to solve a variety of coding problems, especially those involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. You can use this pattern in the following scenarios:

---

### **1. When You Need to Process a Sequence in Two Directions**
- **Scenario**: Problems where you must compare or process elements from both ends of a sequence (e.g., strings, arrays).
- **Examples**:
  - Check if a string is a palindrome.
  - Find pairs in a sorted array that sum to a target value.

---

### **2. When You Need to Optimize Space/Time Complexity**
- **Scenario**: Problems where a brute-force approach involves nested loops, but a two-pointer approach can reduce complexity to \(O(n)\) or \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Examples**:
  - Merging two sorted arrays.
  - Finding duplicates in a sorted array.

---

### **3. When Working with Sorted Arrays or Linked Lists**
- **Scenario**: Problems involving sorted sequences where leveraging the order can simplify finding relationships between elements.
- **Examples**:
  - Removing duplicates from a sorted array.
  - Finding a pair of numbers with a given difference.

---

### **4. When Searching for Subarrays or Substrings**
- **Scenario**: Problems where you must identify or evaluate subarrays or substrings efficiently.
- **Examples**:
  - Finding the maximum sum of a subarray of size \(k\).
  - Longest substring without repeating characters.

---

### **5. When Merging or Interleaving Two Sequences**
- **Scenario**: Problems where you have to combine or analyze two sequences in tandem.
- **Examples**:
  - Merging two sorted linked lists.
  - Comparing elements of two arrays for common elements.

---

### **6. Key Problem Types Suited for Two Pointers**
1. **Two-sum problems** (in sorted arrays).
2. **Palindrome checking** (strings or linked lists).
3. **Sliding window problems** (often used in conjunction).
4. **Partitioning arrays** (e.g., segregating even and odd numbers).
5. **Finding intersections** of two sorted arrays or linked lists.

---

### **When Not to Use the Two Pointers Pattern**
- The input is not sorted, and sorting adds complexity that negates the benefit of two pointers.
- The problem requires more than \(O(n)\) complexity inherently (e.g., problems with complex graph structures or recursion).
